An Object-centric Interaction Framework for Tangible Interfaces in Virtual Environments (TUI-Framework)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this TUI-framework is to support the development of physically enriched VR applications.
It focuses on the spatial and manipulative properties of tangible user interfaces (TUI-objects), leaving it to the application to implement interaction techniques, semantics and expressive physical/digital couplings.

On the programming side, the primary goals of the framework are the integration of a device abstraction layer, a lightweight application programming interface and full
duplex communication between the TUI-application and interaction devices. The framework allows for a distributed system configuration and is highly customizable. Various virtual reality tracking frameworks and devices (e.g. VRPN, Ascension MotionStar, force-feedback devices) and physical toolkits (e.g. Phidgets) are already integrated. Further adapters can also easily be integrated.

The capabilities and flexibility of the framework are illustrated by some examples supplied along with the framework source code.

The concept of the framework and ways to include it in own applications are explained in
